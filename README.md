# Talks

### Note ❤️
Hi there!👋 thanks for taking a look into my talks repository. <br>
I'm a Software Engineer and I really enjoy giving talks(in Spanish or English) about different topics in the software development area **just for fun**. <br>

If you are interested in hearing about one of these or other talks in your **school** or **organization** don't hesitate to send me an email at <areviana17@gmail.com>. I'm happy to share the knowledge that I have been getting around my dev years 😊.
